# Pizzashop Database Design & BI

In this project I build and design a SQL database, write queries and build dashboards for a fictional pizzashop. 
An ER datamodel is designed and setup with MySQL where I use Workbench to write queries. The database is connected to Google Data Studio for the dashboarding.
